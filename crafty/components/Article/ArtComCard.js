            The coasters shipped immediately, which was awesome! However, the
            coasters only ship in a bit of bubble wrap and a bubble wrap
            envelope, no box for protection. A coaster was chipped (no
            surprise), and I donâ€™t have any time to try and fix the situation.
            While the coasters are beautiful, the emblem is slightly off
            centered.
